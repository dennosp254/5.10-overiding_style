        <h1>The pine trees of the world.</h1>
        <h2>Featuring Kijabe</h2>
        <p class="summary">
            Pine trees belong to a family of trees called <strong>conifer</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Geographical Distribution</h2>
        <p class="article description" id="pine">
            Most regions of the Northern hemisphere host some native species of pines. <a class="note" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pine">More info</a>. This doesn't mean that pine trees do not grow in the southern hemisphere.<br>
            Take <em>Kijabe</em> for example.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Kijabe</h2>
        <p class="article description">
            Kijabe is in the Sounthern Hemisphere, but has a diverse population of pine trees.
        </p>
        <h4>Is this weird?</h4>
        <p class="article short-note">Not exactly.</p>
        <p class="article description">
            Weird explanation: Geographically speaking, the earth rotates on a tilted axis, which means that for almost half of the day, Kijabe is in the Northern Hemisphere (at least if we consider the cosmic plane).
        </p>
        <p id="short-note">
            Really, though, we started by saying that <a href="#pine">most pine trees grow on the Northern Hemisphere</a>. But does not mean that no pine trees grow in the southern hemisphere.

<!-- Lesson 5.10: Overriding Styles and Specificity
Introduction:

Overriding styles is dependent on Specificity, such that a more specific selector will override styles from a less specific selector.

type selectors are the least specific, and will be overridden by class selectors which will be overridden by id selectors.

In case there are more than one class selector for an element (ie. the element has more than one class each with its own selector), the class that comes the last in the stylesheet will override any styles in the selectors that come before. -->
